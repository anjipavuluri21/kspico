								<p>The ambition to grow from local to global entity was a vision deeply entrenched in the values of the Al-Wazzan Group, as it moved from a young strong entity to a larger and powerful one. And so, in 1999, the new entity was established as Mezzan Holding Company, which built its foundation on scientific principles: it was well-versed in market strategy, consumer behavior, provided high-quality products, and relentlessly developed operational services while maintaining distinguished global partnerships.</p>
